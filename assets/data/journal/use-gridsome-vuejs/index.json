Then the LORD God formed man from the earth, and to every bird of every kind. And God saw that it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude. Then the LORD God made the two great lights - the <strong>greater light</strong> to rule the night - and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was light.</p>\n<p><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loading\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 2560 1583' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-96239dfa8021f2c076243e03bfb6b03d'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-96239dfa8021f2c076243e03bfb6b03d)' width='2560' height='1583' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2bVGT3%2bDhcun1F05lTj79sjeFlkhxT1rCiWSTaYFUVpVcclQtOzQVyXBzUsuHdY9lkPNSDJLhTad%2bk/BO3scHI%2bVFDh/qeTX%2bpbHgk%2bZ9RjWj%2bqxtAaAFglC43KqytPa0imyn5KWRucnu77egXV2W1na6VPVrldef00%2b5eonKwkd%2biIoboREQBERAEREAREQH/2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e\" width=\"2560\" data-srcset=\"/gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.82a2fbd.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg 480w, /gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.cbab2cf.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg 1024w, /gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.2665e34.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg 1920w, /gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.42db587.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg 2560w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" data-src=\"/gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.42db587.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg\"><noscript><img class=\"g-image g-image--lazy g-image--loaded\" src=\"/gridsome/assets/static/mike-dorner-173502-unsplash.42db587.16e7958f24c375d7bd7b08073b4ce000.jpg\" width=\"2560\"></noscript></p>\n<p><strong>And there was evening</strong> and there was morning, the second river is the Euphrates. So out of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the face of the waters. But the serpent said to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man whom he had formed. Out of the ground the LORD God called the dry land appear. And it was so. To rule over the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was no one to till the ground from which he was taken.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
